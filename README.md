### Useful resources

- (https://www.freecodecap.org) - This helped me for problems with css flexbox. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- (https://www.w3schools.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to work with background images. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
